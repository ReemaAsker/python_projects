Over all good deal
Excellent tv
Absolutely Excellent Purchase. I got best price on Flipkart. Have taken 2 years extended warranty from LG. Now my total warranty is 5 years 3+2 Thank You LG and Flipkart
Overall good product.
If you talk about the TV display quality it surpasses other in it's range i got it for 34k, the audio quite too low as what I personally felt, though I knew about it before I bought it with the expectation I bought it fulfilled it by outstanding measure. The installation service also prompt and comfortable. If you get below 38k go for it, it's the best in the range.
Excellent product
Excellent product. Must buy.

I just loved it. Amazing sound and picture quality.
I've been using this TV for past two weeks now. Excellent QLED; The display is amazing and produces all colors with utmost clarity. This VA panel does not wash out the colors while viewing from sides. It has good viewing angle. TV when powered on in the morning takes 60 seconds to boot which is normal to any android TV. Once the TV is up everything works quick; Buttery smooth interface but the spotlight remote disconnects often. It reconnects without any hurdles but we often get notificatio...

Very good TV. Didn't disappoint at all. I was initially worried about the comparison of Motorola TV vs standard and well proven brands like Sony, Samsung and LG. Because one could see other brands in showrooms and feel the experience. But after going through feedback online and also hearing from a friend who had used Motorola TV I went ahead and purchased this 55" inch TV. Its sleek yet Audio (Dolby) is very good.

Bought it as a replacement for my damaged Motorola ZX Pro 55" TV.Picture quality is better than ZX Pro. Better than VU Premium TV also. Upscaling of SD content is excellent. Design isn't bezel-less. There's a thin bezel which protrudes out. Sound quality is acceptable.There are following issues with the TV. 1. Prime videos does not play UHD+HDR contents (Example: The Tomorrow War movie). It'll play normal content, HDR contents and UHD content, but not those videos which are both HDR and ...

Branded TV with excellent features
Tv so far so good, dolby vision is good, hd videos are a bit normal and occasionally you will find pixel breakage, sound is a bit good, for 50k, it's a good purchase but got to wait and see for its reliability, Initial experience is satisfactory when you look for cost effective alternative for sony samsung and lg
Viewing angles are bad. Colors start fading at even 45 degree angles. Android freezes sometimes.
Just awesome go for it

Picture quality and sound output are awesome. The included game pad is an added bonus.Few cons that I found and are manageable for me are -1) Takes some time to boot up and load home screen2) Occasionally lags while navigating and playing games3) Audio delay when connected to sound bar via optical (Works fine when TV output is muted)
Nice Product looking for Q Led must bye
Awesome
Sounds system should give the feel for surround with Dolby Atmos and Vision..but somehow the setup is not fitting with my living room.I feel, I might have to buy a sound system and plug it additionally to get the ambience
The best QLED TV budget buyers can go blindly. Sound quality is fantastic. Plays 4K HDR10 videos without any stutter.
I m writing this review after a week time of use...TV is great and 4k video is hell like good and  sound quality is superb only 30% covers the home and no need to take extra sound system along with this tv.

If you want better picture quality then this is not right for you. I don‚Äôt know whether I only observed this is there someone also observed but not given review. The panel of this tv is VA panel which is hidden by LG as well as Flipkart. If you see at 90 degrees then only this tv looks ok. If you deviate little bit 10 degrees away from tv you will lot of white shade entire tv looks so whitish and it is not even comparable by normal Full HD tv‚Äôs. Such a worst product.

Got this tv for 31.5k during the sale. One of the best 4K tv in this price range.
Delivery was on timeTV was installed on time but installed on fixed wall mount and we can not move the tv to access various ports which are on the back. We have to unmount the tv every time to access the port which is risky. LG should provide installation on flexible wall mount for TV's which have ports on the back.Software response is slow. It takes about 6-10 seconds even to open settings after pressing the button on remote.Smart TV without a voice command  remote again disappoints. Su...

Sound is loud but bass low.Start processing is very quickly . App and mobile connectivity like wi Fi ,screen mirroring and bloothoot is very fast and quick.Go for this without hagitation.

Very nice product. But comes without magic remote. I am still in a dilemma that i will get magic remote to purchase separately or not. Local LG service centre doesn't have stock, even said this model is not compatible with magic remote. Flipkart customer care doesn't know about it. LG customer care is confirming that magic remote will work. So am still confused. Otherwise product is amazing.

Magic remote should have been part of purchased item. Otherwise i am very much satisfied in other aspects. Well built and good picture quality tv.
Picture quality is ok

Rest everything is good except magic remote is not available with this model and Tv panel is not IPA.  sound quality is best.
Sound and picture quality is excellent. Do not compare it with chaines brand and not go for less rating. Sound is crystal clear and enough for domestic use. Overall this TV is very good. One thing is to be noted that screen contrast and sharpness is more better than chaines products and screen life of chaines products are becoming faint after use 4-5 year I feel it in MI TV. Just concept of led bulb that 6 month use its light become lesser than compare new one.Installation part is poor and I...

The picture and sound quality is excellent. TV's picture upscale capability is really good. Can use SD set-top box and TV will upscale it really good. Sound quality with 20 watt speaker is really good. You won't need soundbar or additional speakers even for larger rooms.

Superb picture quality and web os software is quite good and much improved. Ultra HD 4k video clarity is awesome and it's quite clear that LG is best in technology. The only area where LG need to improve is sound quality. I can say sound quality is good but not that much great. Anyway a superb TV which is absolutely value for money
Very very good tv awesome picture quality and sound‚ù§‚ù§

I would not say that the TV is best but if you‚Äôre looking for a budget TV.. go for it. The 4k and HD quality is good and you will enjoy it. Sound is obviously not you can expect to the level of Sony but ok. Connect it from your BT speaker and enjoy. The delivery and installation was super fast. The same was done within 12 hours of my placing the request.
I am so happy for which I was spent for this television. I loved the experience. The display was awesome. Sound was ok but it should be better. Overall experience was so good. I loved it.
This is not qled.. Sound ok, connectivity problem.. Only 8 gb ram.. Picture clarity just led  quality.. Games connectivity is worst experience..

Just imagine a TV with no physical buttons, stop connecting to its remote? How frustrating it is? It has been 2-3 months and the remote randomly stops working after every couple of minutes .. this smart thing proves garbage to me.. I missed my old analogue TV which had far better connectivity to it's remote :(

This TV does not come with Google voice assistant remote,you need to get that seperately......

For watching OTT content the best tv compared to Chinese brands. Netflix even with hd(720p) is great viewing experience. I can watch 4k content on OTT via Wifi connection with out any delay on starting and no buffering at all. For the above mentioned case I have experienced delay in my old mi tv 43inch one.

Am not get in this pack magic remote ,their response not good and my refund amount not been received till date don't buy in online .In this product available magic remote but they given normal one
Good deal in this range
There is difference in opinion about its panel type. Whether it is VA or IPS? LG has not yet revealed about panel type. Viewing angle is not like 178 deg. Magic remote has not been provided thats why we cannot use Alexa and Google voice assistant. You have to purchase magic remote. We can give voice commands through  LG thinq app downloaded in your smart phone but voice recognition is very poor. Compatible magic remote for TV model is not available in India.

Got it during Big billion day sale at 36K including 2 year added Warranty so total warranty of product is now 5 years which is a secure deal considering Panel life if also not that much‚Ä¶At this price it is one of the best in the market considering all brand, Yes Sony is the only brand which is better than LG and LG is 2nd best in the whole Television Market but Sony TV for same specifications will cost you above 50-55K which is too high.. Thus , it provides better experience at budget f...
Bought in Big Billion Sale and got the tv within 7 days. Good delivery by flipkart on those busy days. Coming to LG TV, we were using LG 32 inch tv for last 5 yrs and this was an upgrade. TV is quite nice. WebOS is functional. Easy to use. This does not have a magic remote but I don't think we need that as it have LG thinq app which does it better than remote. Video quality is great as expected. Sound quality is more than what we expected. It's ability to pair with Bluetooth speakers and t...
received in good condition.Delivery is prompt and the same day service engineer installed. thank you flipkart.
Very nice picture and sound qualitied. WebOS is not upto the mark, very clumsy, needs to simplify like Android and  need to add frequently used apps like JioTV
Only There's is One Issue Magic'Remote is not Included Otherwise It's really Good Product gives Wonderful Filling
Very good picture quality, easy to use
Using it for over 7 days. It has amazing picture quality, sound is good thanks to AI mode, low boot up time, connectivity with Bluetooth and WiFi works great, supports all famous OTT apps and best part is it‚Äôs support to IPhone. Just go for it! Thanks to flipkart for delivery in one day and installation done on same day.
Product and service excellent
I have looked for various brands and researched extensively before buying this tv. In short, for people looking for other options, this lg tv beats all other brands like hisense, mi, sansui, kodak, vu, blaunkpunkt, motorola, nokia, thomson etc. I have seen some of the tvs above mentioned by naked eye and no one comes close to this. Other brands boast of extensive features, but as they say they are all "jack of all trades, but master of none". Trust me, hdr on this tv is better than dolby visi...
Over all everything nice
Super purchase... Brilliant Display, Decent sound, Nice service.. Overall üëåüëåüëå

Extraordinary choice I am writing it after using for 1week excellent picture quality with different brightness settings easy connecting good sound quality with little bass specially I like picture ratio adjustment manually
Excellent
Its a mind blowing purchase. This is my fourth LG tv two are crts and it is now working in my brothers houses and the third was 32 inch smart fhd brought in 2013 and now sill in working confition. i reccoment LG tvs for durability and picture clarity. And also sound .The web OS is very userfriendly and in this 2021 model Filmmaker mode is awesome experiance. All ott platform are available and totally nice productPros Awesome picture clarityGood sound outputWeb OS is very good workingiPh...
Great experience. Wonderful picture quality and good sound quality. No issue with grey uniformity. Good viewing angles. Good upscaling capability of tv. Natural colors. And use expert mode for less strain to eyes!
Very good TV. Super picture & sounds, good connectivity. I am fully satisfied. Value for money.
Real vallue for money considering the various features and hi end software support like eArc etc within the given price point. What's missing is the magic remote which I believe should have been provided.  No mention by LG about panel type ( IPS or VA ) but over all I'm satisfied with my purchase.
Very smooth and good
Magic remote should have been given in the Box Instead of basic remote,  LG should have installed android Instead  of web os , aslo connectivity with my Sony home theatre is not good through ARC, sometimes I need to restart both the home theatre and tv for detection,55 inch has IPS panel and it's best, 43 and 50 inch have VA panel (confirmed from LG service center) got 55inch at unbelievable price 44 k during big billion daysAfter one month of usage I can say display is best ,my opinion is...
Excellent TV
Display quality is not good as expected. No magic remote, so without Magic remote no use of Alexa. Side viewing angle is not too good. Sound quality is very good.
Very happy with this  T.V Thanks LG
Pros:- 1. Best value for money if u cannot offer Sony u can blindly go for this.2. Almost equal to natural colurs where as in Samsung it is warm colur.3. Good contrast ratio less then Samsung but still not too worst. 4. Sound is superb for a medium size room.Cons:-1. The panel used is not IPS, compromised viewing angle.2. Without magic remote TV is dumb or kindly install LG application where u can use same magic remote.Overall installation and delivery experience was good
Good picture quality & good work
Nice TV for my family
Good

Everything is good except the filmmakers mode does not work as it was advertised but it will get job done(u can't compare it with Dolby vission). But its not a deal breaker because picture quality is simply awesome.
Very nice thanks flipkart
